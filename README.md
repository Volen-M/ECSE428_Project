### Motivation/Reason for why the project should exist in the world.  Luke
* Make sure you explain what your project is and what problem it is solving. Why was the project needed: is it solving a problem not solved by other products? is it improving over the existing products?

### Does it explain your entire software architecture Ben
* how is your code distributed among the module/packages/repos/

### Does it explain how to run and test your project Hank
### References/Links to every technology that you didn't create yourself (i.e. frameworks, IDEs, version control, issue tracker, cloud hosting platform) Luke
### Does it explain your design decisions, why you decided to choose one technology/framework/coding style/task distribution over the other
### what scenarios is the project not suitable for
* This is where you explain what you didn't implement or test
* The corner cases that you didn't test
* The UI/UX paths that you didn't test
    - Ideally there should only be one way to do something Hank
* What feature are you not implementing due to time limit or limitations
    - Possible extensions to your project  Aidan

### Agile manifesto: application/evolution
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Samuel
* Working software over comprehensive documentation Wiam
* Customer collab over contract negotiation Samuel
* Responding to change over following a plan Luke

### Agile principles
* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software Samuel
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development, Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage Luke
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale Ben
* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project Wiam
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. Wiam
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation Samuel
* Working software is the primary measure of progress Julien
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. Julien
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. Jiawei
* Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential Jiawei
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams Ben
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly. Samuel
